\item Automation the full project
\item Document dependencies
\item Only re-run things that need to be re-run
  \ei

  \note{
    GNU Make is an old tool that was originally for automating the
    compilation of large, complex programs. But it's useful much more
    generally, though it does have some quirks.

    In addition to automating, you'll be documenting the dependencies
    among the steps, and since the dependencies are defined, only
    stuff that needs to be re-run will be.

\note{GNU Make is an old (and rather quirky) tool for automating the
  process of building computer programs. But it's useful much more
  broadly, and I find it valuable for automating the full process of
  data file manipulation, data cleaning, and analysis.

  In addition to {\nhilit automating} a complex process, it also
  {\nhilit documents} the process, including the dependencies among
  data files and scripts.

\itemsep12pt
\item {\tt Make} is for more than just compiling software
\item The {\color{hilit} essence} of what we're trying to do
\item Automates a workflow
\item Documents the workflow
\item Documents the dependencies among data files, code
\item Re-runs only the necessary code, based on what has changed
\ei


\note{People usually think of Make as a tool for automating the
  compilation of software, but it can be used much more generally.

  To me, Make is the essential tool for reproducible research:
  automation plus the documentation of dependencies and workflows.
}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}[fragile]{Fancier example}

\begin{semiverbatim}
\begin{lstlisting}
FIG_DIR = Figs

mypaper.pdf: mypaper.tex $(FIG_DIR)/fig1.pdf $(FIG_DIR)/fig2.pdf
    pdflatex mypaper

# One line for both figures
$(FIG_DIR)/%.pdf: R/%.R
    cd R;R CMD BATCH $(<F)

# Use "make clean" to remove the PDFs
clean:
    rm *.pdf Figs/*.pdf
\end{lstlisting}
\end{semiverbatim}

\note{As I said, you can get really fancy with GNU Make.

  Use variables for directory names or compiler flags. (This example
  is not a good one.)

  Use pattern rules and automatic variables to avoid repeating
  yourself. With {\tt \%}, we have one line covering both
  {\tt fig1.pdf} and {\tt fig2.pdf}. The {\tt \$(<F)}
  is the file part of
  the first dependency. More on this later.

  Look at the manual for Make and the many online tutorials, such as
  the one from Software Carpentry, or {\tt http://kbroman.org/minimal\_make}.
}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[c]{Installing Make}

  \bbi
  \item On Macs, Make should be installed. Type \\
    ``{\tt make --version}''
    to check.

  \item On Windows, probably the easiest is to install
    \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}{Rtools},
    which includes Make.
    \bi
    \item[]
      \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools}{\tt
        \footnotesize cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools}
      \ei
      \ei

      \note{
        Installation of these sorts of command-line tools on Windows
        can be a bit difficult.
      }

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{How do you use Make?}

\vspace{6pt}

{\small
\bi
\item If you name your make file {\tt Makefile}, then just go into the
directory containing that file and type {\tt \color{hilit} make}

\item If you name your make file {\tt something.else}, then type \\
{\tt \color{hilit} make -f something.else}

\item Actually, the commands above will build the {\color{vhilit} first}
  target listed in the make file. So I'll often include something like
  the following.

\begin{quote}
{\tt \color{hilit} all: target1 target2 target3}
\end{quote}

  Then typing {\tt \color{hilit} make all} (or just {\tt
    \color{hilit} make}, if {\tt \color{hilit} all} is listed
  first in the file) will build all of those
  things.

\item To be build a specific target, type {\tt \color{hilit} make target}.
  For example, {\tt \color{hilit} make Figs/fig1.pdf}
\ei
}

\note{
  Details on the use.
}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}[c]{Make with R Markdown}


  To use Make with R Markdown, you'll use a command like:

  \vspace{3mm}

  {\tt R -e "rmarkdown::render('my\_report.Rmd')"}

  \vspace{3mm}

  You'll need to tell your operating system
where it can find \href{https://pandoc.org/}{pandoc}.
\href{http://www.rstudio.com}{RStudio} includes pandoc, but you need
to add the relevant directory to your {\tt PATH}.

\vspace{24pt}

\hspace{3mm} {\hilit Mac}:

\vspace{6pt}

\hspace{9mm} {\ttsm /Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/MacOS/pandoc}

\vspace{24pt}

\hspace{3mm} {\hilit Windows}:

\vspace{6pt}

\hspace{9mm} {\ttsm "c:{\textbackslash}Program Files{\textbackslash}RStudio{\textbackslash}bin{\textbackslash}pandoc"}

\note{
    To use GNU Make with R Markdown, you'll need to be able to turn
    the thing into HTML (or PDF or Word) from the command line. The
    key trick is getting the operating system to know where pandoc can
    be located.  You may also need to tell it about the location of R.
}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c]{Common challenge}

\centerline{\Large PATH}

\note{{\tt PATH} is an environment/system variable that indicates which
  directories the operating system should look through to find
  executable programs.

  So if you type {\tt R} or {\tt pandoc} at the
  command line, the operating system will look through all the folders
  in your {\tt PATH} to find the program to run.

  It can be tricky to get the {\tt PATH} variable set properly.
}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{{\tt {\textasciitilde}/.bash\_profile}}

\vspace{-12pt}

\begin{semiverbatim}
\begin{lstlisting}
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/MacOS/pandoc

noclobber=1    # prevent overwriting of files
IGNOREEOF=1    # disable Ctrl-D as a way to exit
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups

alias cl='clear;cd'
alias rm='rm -i'
alias mv='mv -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
alias ls='ls -GF'
alias 'l.'='ls -d .[a-zA-Z]*'
alias ll='ls -lh'
alias md='mkdir'
alias rd='rmdir'
alias rmb='rm .*~ *~ *.bak *.bk!'

alias Rb='R CMD build --force --resave-data'
alias Ri='R CMD INSTALL --library=/Users/kbroman/Rlibs'
alias Rc='R CMD check --library=/Users/kbroman/Rlibs'
alias Rcc='R CMD check --as-cran --library=/Users/kbroman/Rlibs'
\end{lstlisting}
\end{semiverbatim}


\note{Use the {\tt .bash\_profile} file to define various
  variables and aliases to make your life easier.

The most important variable is {\tt PATH}: it defines the set of
directories where the shell will look for executable programs.
If ``{\tt .}'' isn't part of your {\tt PATH}, you'll need to type
something like {\tt ./myscript.py} to execute a script in your working
directory. So put ``{\tt .}'' in your {\tt PATH}.

My {\tt .bash\_profile} file sources a {\tt .bashrc} file; I don't
quite understand when one is used versus the other. Google ``{\tt .bashrc
vs .bash\_profile}.''
There are links to my {\tt .bash\_profile} and {\tt .bashrc} files on
the resources page at the course web site; some of it might just be
total crap.

If you're using Windows and Git Bash, the {\tt .bash\_profile} file
will be in your Documents folder (I think).

Important note: use of aliases within your code will create
reproducibility issues; another user will need those same aliases.
Consider testing your code on a more basic account.

\begin{frame}[c]{{\tt PATH} in Windows}

\only<1 | handout 0>{\figw{Figs/win_path_1.png}{0.95}}
\only<2 | handout 0>{\figw{Figs/win_path_2.png}{0.95}}
\only<3>{\figw{Figs/win_path_3.png}{0.95}}

\note{With Git Bash, you can have a {\tt {\textasciitilde}/.bash\_profile}
  file that adds stuff to your {\tt PATH}, just as in Mac OS X and Linux.

  But things will also be added to the {\tt PATH} variable via the
  Path system variable and/or a Path user variable.
  You can get to these via the ``Control panel,'' but it's a bit
  cumbersome.

  The simplest way to get to the relevant dialog box seems to be to
  click Win-w (the little windows key and the w key) and searching for
  ``path''.

\end{frame}






\begin{frame}[fragile]{Variables}

  \bbi
\item Define a {\color{vhilit} variable} like

  {\color{hilit} \verb|R_OPTS=--vanilla|}

\item Use it with a \verb|$| and \verb|()| or \verb|{}|, for example:

  {\color{hilit} \verb|R CMD BATCH $(R_OPTS) fig1.R|}

  \ei

\note{Variables are useful shorthand, for bits of code that you want to
  use repeatedly.}


\end{frame}





\begin{frame}[fragile]{Automatic variables}

There are a bunch of {\color{vhilit} automatic variables} that you can use to save
yourself a lot of typing.

\bigskip

Here are the ones I use most:

\bigskip

{\small
\def\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}l}
{\color{hilit} \verb|$@|} & the file name of the target \\
{\color{hilit} \verb|$<|} &  the name of the first dependency \\
{\color{hilit} \verb|$^|} &  the names of all dependencys \\
{\color{hilit} \verb|$(@D)|} &  the directory part of the target \\
{\color{hilit} \verb|$(@F)|} &  the file part of the target \\
{\color{hilit} \verb|$(<D)|} &  the directory part of the first dependency \\
{\color{hilit} \verb|$(<F)|} &  the file part of the first dependency
\end{tabular}
}

\note{You'll see on the next slide how automatic variables get used.}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Pattern rules}

Pattern rules are like wildcards for file names: if a bunch of files
are to be built the same way, you can use the symbol {\color{hilit}
  \verb|%|} as a wildcard.

\bigskip

For example, if you have two figures {\tt fig1.pdf} and {\tt fig2.pdf}
that are to be built by {\tt fig1.R} and {\tt fig2.R}, respectively,
you might do:

\bigskip

{\color{hilit}

\verb|Figs/%.pdf: R/%.R|

\verb|    cd $(<D);R CMD BATCH $(<F)|
}

\bigskip

The two figures' file names will need to be be spelled out somewhere,
for example as dependencies.


\note{Pattern rules can greatly reduce the length of your {\tt
    Makefile}, but they can also be rather frustrating. I recommend
  keeping things really simple initially and then move to pattern
  rules later, after you've been working with Make for a while.}
